# Python-code
 
 Hello all. This is my first Repository in Github.I will be uploading codes on Python, R.
 So kindly support and follow my account. Thanks in advance.
 
 As this is my first code, I have uploaded a Calculator using Python.
I have uploaded 2 types of Calculator code.

1)Simple Calculator in one Expression
   
   Through this simple calculator you can perform five operations using only 2 inputs.
   The five operations are 
   1)Addition 2) Subtraction 3)Multiplication 4) Division 5) Modulo
   
   It will ask for "Enter the expression (Ex:2+3) (+,-,*,/,%) (0 for Exit) :" .
   You can enter any digit number followed by an operator ( only use 5 operators mentioned above) and then a number again.
   Unlike other calculators getting input like "Enter the first number: Enter the second number:", I have made code in such a way that it asks for an expression.
   No need to give enter and space after numbers and operators.
   
   It will automatically seperate the operator and the two numbers from the expression using re.split
   If you are giving some other operators which are not mentioned in the above list. It will return the output as "Invalid Operator"
   
   After performing the operation if you want to exit press 0. It will exit from the program.
   
2) Calculator 8 operations with n inputs

      This calculator is an advanced one. Because here you can perform 8 operations with any number of inputs.
      For better understanding, comment (lines starting with #) is made in the code.
      
      It will open with "-----Welcome-----  Enter 1 to use multiple operators like (3+5*3/4) or Enter 2 to perform any one operation or Enter 0 to Exit :"
      If you are going to use multiple operators press 1 and enter the inputs with multiple operators as an expression. And you will get the output.
      
      Or if you want to use only one operation press 2. Adn select the choice of operation you want to perform.The 8 operations are
      1)Addition 2) Subtraction 3)Multiplication 4) Division 5) Modulo 6) Gratest of all numbers 7)Smallest of all numbers 8)Mean of all numbers.
      
      Then enter the number of inputs you want to perfrom operation. Then enter the values one by one. You can add both int and float values.
      If your input is apart from int and float you will get message as "Please enter a valid integer or float value".
      
      After entering the inputs you will get the answer like "The answer is 27 Thank you for using this calculator..."
      For each of the inputs you are entering wrongly apart from the choice given, you will get proper validation messages given in else statement.
      Enter 0 to come out of the calculator.
